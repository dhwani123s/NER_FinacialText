Project Overview:

The project focuses on implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) for financial text. The objective is to identify and classify entities such as organizations, locations, monetary values, and other relevant entities in financial documents. This is achieved by utilizing both traditional NLP libraries like SpaCy and advanced models like BERT. The project involves preprocessing the text data, training the NER models, and evaluating their performance to ensure accurate entity recognition.

Skills Developed:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Gained proficiency in preprocessing text data, tokenization, and utilizing libraries like SpaCy for NLP tasks.
  - Machine Learning: Acquired skills in training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly for sequence tagging tasks.
  - Data Analysis: Enhanced ability to handle and analyze large datasets, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
  - Deep Learning: Developed understanding of deep learning models like BERT for advanced NLP applications.
  - Python Programming: Improved Python programming skills through the implementation of various NLP and ML techniques.

Technology Used:
  - Python: The primary programming language used for data processing and model implementation.
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - SpaCy: For building and training the NER model.
  - Transformers (Hugging Face): For leveraging pre-trained BERT models for NER.
  - Scikit-Learn: For train-test split and evaluation metrics.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - Torch: For deep learning operations required by BERT.

Use Case:

In the financial sector, accurate extraction of entities such as company names, monetary values, dates, and other relevant terms from large volumes of unstructured text is crucial. This project addresses the need for automated NER in financial documents, enabling more efficient data extraction and analysis. Such a system can be used in various applications including automated report generation, compliance monitoring, sentiment analysis, and improving financial decision-making processes.
